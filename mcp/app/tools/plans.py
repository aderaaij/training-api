    markers only — they are NOT pushed to the Apple Watch (that's for running
    interval workouts). Completed strength sessions auto-match by date via the
    HealthKit `traditionalStrength` workouts that Hevy already syncs in.

    scheduled runs, and place strength days on free weekdays. The response also
