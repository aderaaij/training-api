    Run this after queueing or reshuffling a plan's workouts, and before
    presenting a plan to the athlete as final. It is pure arithmetic over the
    queue + the athlete's real workout history — no LLM judgment — checking
    the coaching playbook's numeric invariants: weekly ramp vs the actual
    4-week baseline, missing down weeks, long-run share, back-to-back hard
    days, taper shape before `race_date`, and the plan's own declared
    guardrails.

    Interpreting results: `critical` warnings should be resolved (adjust the
    schedule and re-queue) or explicitly signed off by the athlete; `warn`
    items should at least be mentioned; `info` is context. `estimated: true`
    means the numbers rest on a pace assumption (time-based steps without a
    pace alert). Warnings never block anything.

    Note `strength_collision` (info) fires for a hard run the day *after* a
    strength session — an interference heads-up, deliberately broader than
    the calendar's `conflict` flag, which only marks two sessions sharing a
    date. A day-after warning here with conflict=false on the calendar is
    consistent, not contradictory.

    Args:
        plan_id: UUID of the plan whose context (guardrails, race date)
            frames the check. The schedule itself is always the athlete's
            full upcoming queue — runs from other plans count too.
