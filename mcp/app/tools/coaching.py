"""MCP tool serving the coaching playbook.

The playbook is served as a tool (rather than only an MCP prompt or server
instructions) because tools are the one primitive every MCP client supports —
so any LLM client gets the same methodology on demand, and the content can be
updated server-side without any client changing configuration.

    """Load the coaching methodology to follow when acting as a running coach.

    ALWAYS call this before creating a training plan, materially revising one,
    or advising on training structure/load. It returns the evidence-based
    playbook this system follows — pace zones from actual data, intensity
    distribution, progression and recovery rules, readiness gating, and how to
    map methodology onto this API's plans/queue/calendar — plus a module
    tailored to the athlete's goal.

    Not needed for simple data questions ("what did I run last week?").

    Args:
        goal: The athlete's training goal. Use "first_5k" for someone who has
            never run or is starting from zero (couch-to-5K style walk/run
            progression); "general_fitness" when there is no target race.
            Omit if the goal isn't known yet — the core playbook still applies,
            and its intake section helps establish the goal.
        experience: The athlete's experience level, judged from their actual
            training history (get_recent_runs / get_training_summary), not
            self-report alone. Omit to get guidance for all levels.

    Returns:
        Object with:
          - playbook: the methodology as markdown (core principles + goal
            module when a goal was given)
          - goal / experience: what the content was tailored to (null = generic)
          - available_goals: valid goal values
          - warning: present if the requested goal was unknown
