    List recent workouts, optionally filtered by activity type and date range.

        activity_type: Filter by activity type (e.g. "running", "cycling", "swimming").
                       If omitted, returns all activity types.
        limit: Maximum number of workouts to return (default 10, max 200).
        start_after: Only return workouts starting after this datetime (ISO 8601).
                     Example: "2026-03-01T00:00:00"
        start_before: Only return workouts starting before this datetime (ISO 8601).
                      Example: "2026-03-15T23:59:59"

        List of workout objects with fields: id, activity_type, start_date, end_date,
        duration, total_distance, total_energy_burned, source, plan_workout_id,
        effort_score, estimated_effort_score, created_at.

        - source: the HealthKit bundle id of the recording app —
          "com.apple.health.<UUID>" means recorded directly on the Apple Watch
          (the UUID is the device, not an app); others name the app, e.g.
          com.hevyapp.hevy (Hevy strength), com.strava.stravaride (Strava),
          com.garmin.connect.mobile (Garmin), com.bowery-digital.bend (Bend
          stretching).
        - effort_score: User-rated post-workout RPE (1–10) from the Apple Watch
          effort prompt. The user's perception of the workout — trust it as the
          primary signal. May be null when the workout predates iOS 18 / watchOS 11
          or the user dismissed the prompt.
        - estimated_effort_score: Apple's algorithmic RPE estimate (1–10) computed
          from heart rate / activity. Useful for cross-referencing against
          effort_score; a large gap (e.g. user 8 vs. estimate 5) can indicate
          non-cardiovascular load (heat, sleep debt, dehydration, illness, life
          stress) that HR-based estimates miss — worth surfacing during weekly
          review when it appears repeatedly. May be null when no estimate exists.

        Treat null as "no signal," not "low effort."

        Workout object with all fields including the nested data object

        data.events contains only meaningful events (pause/resume); HealthKit
        segment events are pruned — they duplicate the interval structure that
        activities and splits already encode.

        Includes effort_score (user-rated RPE 1–10 from Apple Watch effort prompt;
        primary signal of perceived effort) and estimated_effort_score (Apple's
