"""MCP tools for plan continuity notes.

These tools let the LLM persist short-form notes about the user's training
plan across conversations. The goal is continuity: any future conversation
can fetch the latest decisions, preferences, and life context with a single
call to ``get_plan_context`` — making each new conversation feel like a
continuation rather than a cold start.

The write tool (``append_plan_note``) is intentionally low-friction: short
notes are cheap, and missing a note is more costly than saving one too many.

    ALWAYS call this FIRST in any training-related conversation, before
    answering the user. It returns the active plan plus recent notes
    (decisions, preferences, constraints, life context, blockers,
    observations) ranked by importance and recency. This is how you maintain
    continuity across conversations.

    The response includes a `continuity_hint` string — read it. It tells you

    Call this WITHOUT BEING ASKED whenever ANY of the following happens
    during a conversation:

      • User states a preference. Trigger phrases: "I prefer", "I like",
        "I hate", "from now on", "going forward", "always", "never".
      • User makes a plan decision. Trigger phrases: "let's drop", "let's
        switch", "let's add", "I've decided", "I'm going to", "this week
        I'll", "starting Monday".
      • User reveals life context that affects training. Examples:
        travel, illness, injury, sleep debt, work stress, life events,
        weather constraints, schedule shifts.
      • User commits to a change in approach.
      • A non-obvious insight emerges that future-you would want to know
        but couldn't infer from workout data alone.

    DO save short, partial notes — they are cheap. DO NOT save: chitchat,
    things derivable from workout/health-metrics data, code-level details,
    or one-off acknowledgments.

    Tip: if a note is temporal (e.g. "traveling Mar 1–5"), set
    `expires_at` so it auto-fades from future context.

    Args:
        kind: One of:
          - "decision"     — the user committed to a plan-level change
          - "preference"   — a stable preference about how training works
          - "constraint"   — a hard limit (schedule, equipment, injury)
          - "life_context" — temporary life situation affecting training
          - "observation"  — non-obvious insight worth remembering
          - "blocker"      — something preventing planned training
          - "feedback"     — the athlete's own review of a plan or block
            (the dashboard's plan wrap-up flow writes these too)
        summary: One-line summary, ≤280 chars. Lead with the fact, not
            "the user said". Example: "Prefers morning runs, never evenings."
        body: Optional longer body — the *why*, edge cases, exceptions.
            Future-you reads this when the summary alone is ambiguous.
        importance: 1=low, 2=med (default), 3=high. Use 3 sparingly for
            hard constraints and committed decisions.
        expires_at: Optional ISO 8601 datetime. After this, the note is
            excluded from `get_plan_context` results. Use for temporal
            life_context notes (travel, short-term illness, etc.).
        plan_id: Optional plan UUID. Omit for global notes that apply
            across all plans (e.g. stable preferences).
        conversation_id: Optional opaque string to group all notes from
            one conversation. Use a stable id throughout the conversation
            so future-you can replay what was discussed together.

        The created PlanNote object.
