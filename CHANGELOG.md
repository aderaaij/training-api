# Changelog

Notable changes to Loopback Server. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) — with the usual 0.x caveat that
**breaking changes bump the minor version** until 1.0.

Each release `vX.Y.Z` is a git tag and publishes multi-arch Docker images
tagged `X.Y.Z` and `X.Y` to GHCR (see README "Releases & upgrading").
The running server reports its version at `/api/health` and on the admin
System screen.

## [0.1.6] — 2026-07-24

### Fixed

- **`POST /api/plan-notes` now accepts `kind: "feedback"`.** The plan-completion
  flow wrote feedback notes ORM-side and the MCP's `append_plan_note` advertised
  the kind, but the request schema's pattern predated it — so authoring one via
  the API 422'd. Note kinds are now single-sourced in `NOTE_KINDS` (used by both
  the create and update schemas).
- **The MCP surfaces the API's error detail instead of a bare status code.**
  A validation failure used to reach the LLM as an opaque
  `Client error '422 Unprocessable Content'`, leaving it to retry the same
  payload blindly. The MCP's HTTP client now parses the response body (including
  FastAPI's field-level validation errors) into the raised message, e.g.
  `Training API returned 422 for POST /api/plan-notes: summary: String should
  have at most 280 characters`.

## [0.1.5] — 2026-07-23

### Added

- **Sample-free workout detail.** `GET /api/workouts/{id}?include_samples=false`
  replaces the raw per-second arrays in `data` (GPS `route`, `cadence`,
  `heartRate`) with a compact `data.samplesSummary` — per-series count and
  avg/min/max, plus jitter-filtered elevation gain/loss for the route. A GPS
  run's detail response shrinks from ~650 kB to a few kB. The MCP's
  `get_workout_detail` and `get_workout_activities` now always request the
  compact form (the full payload, doubled by MCP text+structured serialization,
  exceeded 1 MB and broke LLM clients); `get_workout_heartrate` and
  `get_workout_splits` still serve the raw series. The default response is
  unchanged, so the dashboard's route map and charts are unaffected.

## [0.1.4] — 2026-07-23

### Added

- **Per-token client visibility.** Each API token now remembers the last
  client `User-Agent` seen on it (written alongside the existing throttled
  `last_used_at` bookkeeping — an agent change, e.g. an app update, always
  writes immediately). Token lists in the dashboard (admin Users screen and
  own Settings) show a compact client label — e.g. `Loopback iOS 1.0`,
  `browser` — with the full string on hover, and the `lastUserAgent` field is
  on both token wire shapes. Groundwork for the iOS app's version handshake:
  once the app sends `Loopback-iOS/<version>`, the admin can answer "which
  devices still run an old app" before shipping a breaking change.

## [0.1.3] — 2026-07-23

### Added

- **Stranded-device visibility.** A device still presenting a revoked,
  expired, or deactivated-account bearer token used to fail with silent 401s;
  those rejections now appear as `token_rejected` events in the admin
  auth-activity feed. Expired/inactive rejections name the user and token
  ("alice's token 'iPhone' rejected — expired"); unknown tokens can't be
  attributed and show a short token fingerprint instead, so repeats are
  recognizable. Events are throttled per device (per source IP for unknown
  tokens) to at most one per 6 hours, so a retrying device or a scanner can't
  flood the feed.

## [0.1.2] — 2026-07-23

### Added

- **First-run setup screen.** A fresh install now greets the browser with a
  create-admin-account screen instead of a dead login form: the dashboard
  detects that no admin password exists (`GET /api/auth/setup`) and walks you
  through creating the account (`POST /api/auth/setup`), landing you signed
  in. The endpoints close permanently once a passworded admin exists — a
  deactivated admin keeps them closed, and an existing passworded account can
  never be taken over; lockout recovery stays the CLI. The POST is
  rate-limited like login and completing setup shows up in the admin
  auth-activity feed. `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` works unchanged for
  headless/scripted installs and skips the screen entirely.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-07-23

### Added

- **Server-managed backups.** The server now backs itself up: a nightly
  `pg_dump` into the `/backups` mount (`BACKUP_TIME`, default 03:30 container
  time; newest `BACKUP_KEEP` dumps retained, default 30), a catch-up backup
  shortly after startup when the newest dump is stale, and — new safety net —
  an automatic dump **right before pending database migrations** run on an
  upgrade. The admin System screen gains a **Back up now** button
  (`POST /api/admin/backup`). Set `BACKUP_ENABLED=false` to keep managing
  backups yourself; freshness reporting works either way.

### Changed

- The compose `/backups` mount is read-write by default now (was `:ro`).
  Host-managed setups should add `:ro` back in an override file alongside
  `BACKUP_ENABLED=false`.
- The Docker image includes `postgresql-client` (pg_dump).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-23

First tagged release — everything before this shipped straight from `main`.

### Highlights

- **Workout storage & analytics** for all HealthKit workout types (running,
  cycling, strength, …) with splits, heart-rate samples, cadence, GPS routes,
  and summary aggregation by week/month/year
- **Apple Watch training queue**: structured workouts (intervals, pace alerts)
  served as WorkoutKit compositions to the companion iOS app, with device
  inventory, edit/delete actions, and missed-workout feedback
- **Training plans** with goals, guardrails, and phases; recurring weekly
  strength schedules; a unified calendar merging runs and strength sessions
  with conflict flags; an explicit plan-completion flow
- **Plan validation** — a deterministic schedule "linter": weekly-ramp and
  taper checks, missing down weeks, back-to-back hard days, guardrail breaches
- **Daily health metrics**: sleep, heart rate, HRV, weight, VO₂max, steps,
  body composition
- **Multi-user auth**: argon2 passwords, per-device revocable API tokens,
  rate-limited login, and an auth audit trail
- **Web dashboard** (React SPA served same-origin by the API): athlete screens
  for overview/calendar/workouts/plans/notes/health/queue, plus an admin
  console for user/token management and system monitoring
- **MCP server** so any MCP client can act as an AI running coach over your
  own data (stdio or streamable HTTP, per-user token passthrough, coaching
  playbook)
- **Self-host niceties**: single `.env` configuration, GHCR multi-arch images
  (amd64/arm64), automatic migrations on startup, backup-freshness reporting,
  and an isolated demo stack with a synthetic-athlete seeder
